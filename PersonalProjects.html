          </h3>
          <br>
          <p style="max-width:80%;">
            A fan comic of one of my personal favorite series, "Beastar" which have an unfortunate ending to the series which left a bad taste in my mouth despite the high expectations it set in the 
            early chapters. TUBEFU ("The Unofficial Beastar Expanded Fan Universe"), aims to expand further the concepts and ideas of the setting while working with the official ending. Which I hoped
            would improved upon my writing and world building skills since I have to worked with building up from where the series officially left while building and expanding on the existing concepts
            of the setting and themes.
            <br><br>
            Currently it's became the main focus point for me despite me having an original IP in the working for  years, the impact of the original ending of this series has made me reorient my priorities
            on writing on this project, other than improving my skill and growing my audience, is born out my personal interest and love of the setting and themes of the series's theme and setting. Since it's
            a more brutal, realistic depiction of an anthromorphic animal society. Despite for some of it flaw remains one of the few fictional setting that spark my interest into a fictional setting and it's
            themes.

            A long time personal project in the work, which I've had worked on planning, concept experiementing, research and desigining on for a total of 6/7 years. Mostly being stucked on itearation, which
            every iterated ideas and design leading into further reasearch amd developing, and those leads back to reiterate and redesign which leads to further reasearch. Which loops again and again and again.
            Despite not starting production of storyline or visual story, the entire 6/7 years of planning and conceptualizing has help me develop an enjoyment of doing cultural & historical research

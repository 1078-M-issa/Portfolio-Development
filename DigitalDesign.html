            A vacational postercard taking place in South East Asia, set place under an alternative timeline where Germany won the First World War, dubbed KaiseReich (Emperor's Realm).
            Taking place where the Central Power of Germany, Austria-Hungary, & The Ottomans won over the allied forces. Germany has become the foremost global super-power in the 20th
            centruy and inherited the former colonies of Brtiain & France.
            <br><br>
            The Postercard in particular is based on the Sultan Abdul Samad Buidling, formerly used by the British as a goverment offices in it's early years, it's existance in the 20th
            century and unique design would be an ideal for a Postercard for travellers wanting to give warm greeting to their loved one in the Fatherland, from the crown colony of East
            Asia.

          <P> 
            Designed and created a CCA Flyer for Singapore Polytechnic Fencing Club via a friend's request, the design of the flyer relied around the front image which was provided by said friend.
            I adapted a sense of rhytm and contrast due to the black and white colour of the image, along with the forward momentum created by the foreground characther. I aligned the fonts in a way
            it complemented the rhytm of the image while creating a balance between the whites and black of the front image.
            <br><br>
            The biggest challenge of this work was actually the back of the flyer. Given the black and white image of the front I couldn't use colour combonation as it would be out of place Given
            the front image. Which would make it akward and bizzare. I started off simple with the outline image of the 2 fencers, from there I build the layout of back to store in key informations
            that is neccessary to give just enough information to fufill any begining inquiry for them to further find more information of the CCA on their own accord.
            <br><br>
            To further improve upon the design and improve the unity between the front and back I've applied gradient colour that reflected the colour split at the front, to give a sense of end and unity.
            Further more I've applied special effect on the texture of the background, to avoid it being dull and plain and add a bit of characther to it.

        Budget Visionary

          <P> 

            A design mockup for a moblie Budgeting application, title "Budget Visionary", where I used it to experiement and test with design application that cater people with colour blindness.
            Given the wide variety of colour blindness such as Deuteranopia, Protanopia, and Tritanopia, this would help further my design prowess by limiting my choice and finding ways
            to design appealing while appealing to colour blinded users.
            <br><br>
            Before going into designing the colour blind design, I've created the design for the general users. When creating the general design, I make sure that the design would be somewhat be viewable
            and navigatable for colourblind users to atleast get the setting and change it  to colourblind mode. I've achieve it mostly by using light text on dark background, which work generally well
            for the three types of colourblindness

          </P>
        </div>

        <div class="col-5" style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5%; margin-left: 5%;">
          <P> 

            The following image showcase the methods I used to make the design more accomodating to colour blind users while keeping the integrity of the general design. 
            The key design principles I utilize to accomadate users while keeping the core design are contrast, emphasis, and white space. With these 3 concepts I then chose
            what elements I want to utilize to achieve those principles are colour values, texture, and space.
            <br><br>
            The changes that I've made were the following, apply higher contrast between text and background by change colour and increasing colour value. The next step I took
            to improve my design further is applying texture whenever it helps make the contrast between foreground and background, such as charts, graphs and etc. The final
            element that I chose to accomadate colour blind users are the uses of white space. Which helps elevate the contrast further between foreground objects and background.
